	<article>MS-DOS is an acronym for Microsoft Disk Operating System.<br><br>
		Version 1.23 was first version officially released for a small number of OEM’s (Original Equipment
		Manufacturers) in Febuary of 1982 after the purchase of 86-DOS by Microsoft on the 27th of July 1981 (originally
		produced by Seattle Computer Products). However, according to MS-DOS 2.11 Source code, There are versions dating
		back to MS-DOS 1.11 which are unreleased internal versions of the Operating System. The next version released
		was 1.24 in Mach of 1982, this was released to IBM and renamed to IBM® Personal Computer™ DOS 1.10, it supported
		bot Single (160 KB) and double (320 KB) sided 5.25 inch floppy disks (known colloquially as 5 and a quarter inch
		floppies) and support was not yet included for sub-directories (all files must be located in the root directory)
		as a result of this, the backward (<code>\</code>) and forward (<code>/</code>) slash symbols can be used in
		file names amongst others. The next release was version 1.25 which was released to other OEM’s than just IBM in
		the August of 1982 and had only one minor change over 1.24 which was that the <code>00</code> marker was placed
		at the end of directories to speed up searching. The next edition of MS-DOS was 2.x which was released in March
		of 1983 after 12 (confirmed) unreleased development builds.</article>
