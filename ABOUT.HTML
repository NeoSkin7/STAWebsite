		<h4>A Message from The Founder</h4>
		<p>Hello there, and welcome to the Skinner Technolgy Archive. I created it in 2020 to serve a singular purpose – to keep and share old software, and the knowledge and information necessary to use and learn about them.</p>
		<p>My interest in computers began when I was 11. My first computer was a Dell Inspiron 6400/E1505 running Windows Vista (it’s not really too bad!). The earliest software I remember using is Microsoft Works 9.</p>
		<p>From that time on, I was hooked on everything tech, cementing my firm identity as a nerd. Windows 7 was the first Operating System that I started using VirtualBox on, and provided me the inspiration to create STA. I was just a teen who wanted to create a website dedicated to keeping old software and making it easily accessible to anyone anywhere.</p>
		<p>Sincerely,</p>
		<p><em><b>NeoSki</b></em></p>
